# NEEMSIS-1 (2016-17)

This repository contains codes relating to the first wave of the *Network, Employment, dEbt, Mobility, and Skills in South India Survey* (NEEMSIS). This wave was conducted in rural Tamil Nadu in 2016-17, in more than 10 villages and 492 households.

* The [`Variables`](https://github.com/neemsis/NEEMSIS-1/tree/main/Variables) folder contains `.do` files for creating variables from NEEMSIS-1 data.
* The [`Merging_cleaning`](https://github.com/neemsis/NEEMSIS-1/tree/main/Merging_cleaning) folder contains `.do` files for merging and cleaning NEEMSIS-1 datasets.[^1]

[^1]: These codes are only useful when recovering data from `SurveyCTO` or `KoboToolbox` servers and cleaning them.
